👋 Welcome!
This repository contains solutions for four fundamental Python programming assignments. The purpose of this collection is to demonstrate proficiency in basic data structures, iteration, and conditional logic in Python.

🚀 Setup and Installation
These assignments are written in standard Python and require no external libraries.

💡 Execution Instructions
Each function within the assignments.py file is typically called at the end of the script to demonstrate its output.

Expected Output
The script will execute the test cases embedded within the file and print the results directly to the console, demonstrating the correctness of each solution (e.g., Vowel Counting, List Reversal, etc.).
